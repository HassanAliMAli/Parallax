# Servers

This directory houses reference implementations and best practices for building MCP servers across different languages and frameworks.

## Structure

Each server implementation should include:

```
servers/
â”œâ”€â”€ typescript/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ python/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Planned Server Implementations

**TODO:** Add server scaffolds for:

- [ ] TypeScript + Fastify/Express
- [ ] Python + FastAPI
- [ ] Rust + Axum
- [ ] Go + Gin
- [ ] Java + Spring Boot

## Server Guide Requirements

Each server implementation should include:

1. **Overview** - Purpose and architecture summary
2. **Setup** - Development environment instructions
3. **Configuration** - Environment variables and configuration files
4. **Command Reference** - Scripts for building, testing, and running
5. **Deployment Guide** - How to deploy to various environments
6. **Security Notes** - Authentication, authorization, and data handling
7. **Monitoring** - Logging, metrics, and observability guidance
8. **Testing** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end strategies

## Quality Checklist

- âœ… Automated linting and formatting
- âœ… Unit and integration tests
- âœ… Structured configuration with `.env` templates
- âœ… Deployment-ready Dockerfile (if applicable)
- âœ… Security and privacy considerations documented

**Status:** ðŸš§ Server examples will be added incrementally.
