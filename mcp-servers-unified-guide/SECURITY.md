# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The MCP Servers Unified Guide team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### üîí How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**security@mcp.guide** *(TODO: Update with actual security contact email)*

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

### üìù What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., credential exposure, injection vulnerability, privilege escalation)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Update Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Investigation**: Our team will investigate and validate the issue
3. **Resolution**: We will work on a fix and determine the release timeline
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on disclosure timing
5. **Credit**: We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## üîê Supported Versions

**TODO:** Update with actual version support policy once releases begin.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- **Never commit credentials** or API keys to the repository
- Use `.env.example` files for configuration templates
- Sanitize all example code to remove sensitive data
- Review dependencies regularly for known vulnerabilities
- Follow secure coding practices in all examples

### For Users

- **Keep dependencies updated** to the latest secure versions
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Validate all inputs** in production deployments
- **Enable TLS/SSL** for all network communications
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Follow the principle of least privilege** for access controls
- **Audit logs regularly** for suspicious activity

## üîç Security Considerations for MCP Servers

### Credential Management

- Store API keys and secrets securely using secret managers
- Never hardcode credentials in source code
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use separate credentials for development and production

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS/WSS for all client-server communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use authentication and authorization for all endpoints
- Consider using VPNs or private networks for sensitive deployments

### Docker Security

- Use official base images from trusted sources
- Keep base images updated with security patches
- Run containers as non-root users when possible
- Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- Limit container privileges and capabilities

### Data Privacy

- Minimize data collection and storage
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Comply with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Provide clear privacy policies and user controls

## üìã Dependency Security

We use automated tools to monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Audit npm dependencies
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities automatically (when possible)
npm audit fix

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

## üö® Known Security Considerations

**TODO:** Document any known security considerations or limitations.

### Current Areas of Focus

- [ ] Credential management best practices
- [ ] Secure communication protocols
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Logging and monitoring security events
